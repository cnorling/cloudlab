# ABOUT CLOUDLAB

This is a personal repository I use to publicly illustrate how I setup infrastructure as code in pulumi. If gitops, kubernetes, and infrastructure as code interests you, this repository is worth looking at.

## but isn't the cloud really expensive?

it can be, but there are tricks and things you can do in a kubernetes ecosystem that make working in a cloud provider like GCP a lot cheaper than you would think. My homelab costs me around $60 a month. That doesn't include one-time related costs like buying domain names.

## how can I minimize cloud homelabbing costs?

The best place to start is the [cost calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator). It does a good job at illustrating how much what you want to do will cost you. The next best thing you can do is use the free cloud credits they give you.
